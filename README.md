Title: Github Repo reader

Summary:

Repository url: https://github.com/abusaeed2433/JavaInREADME

Use this repository as the data source. Then create a spring boot application having some get endpoints only. The endpoints are as follows:

    1. /api/v1/read_contributions: Return the contributors of the repository as response.

    2. /api/v1/read_indices: Return the indices. See example response.

    3. /api/v1/read_blog?topic_name={x}&sub_topic_name={y}: Return the blog info.


You can see the example response using this base url: https://apiendpoint.site/jir/


No UI is required — this is a backend-only, API-based project.

Requirements:

    - Changes made in the repository(main repo, or cloned one[if you clone]) should reflect in the endpoint within a day.

    - Use any persistent database.

    - Rest is yours. You can use anything you want to.

    - Be careful about performance and follow standards.

Hint:

    - Clone the repo, Github access token, Schedular, Topic orders is available in base readme, Readme parsing.

These are all optional. There is no restriction as long as you can fulfill the requirements.
